My embarassing first React project. Would have benefited from a state management library or more developed  plan from the outset. Deciding against PassportJS was also likely a mistake, but was educational at least. Eventually I convinced myself this was a good thing. We'll call it 'simulating tech-debt'. They can't all be green field projects! Working but left in a terrible state with dangling wires from previous revisions left hanging. Abandon all hope... et cetera, et cetera. 

- MERN Stack, React Bootstrap. 
- Uses Cloudinary and MongoDB Atlas API's. 
- Axios, CompressorJS, Exifr, Google-map-react, JWT, Bcypt, Multer.
